# arlo_app

## Written in Flutter  

#### 10 hour builds? 
This project came about namely as a way of me trying to build a full application with both front end and backend in less than 10 hours. I will continue to try this, but IRL its a nightmare. 

#### Background 
Arlo is a simple gratitude tracker which at haze of the moment had seemed like a great idea + might have been possible to build in 10 hours. I still think if people restrospect on their day and think about the positives they will realise that we generally have life good. 

#### What now 
Ummm...feel free to fork the repo and maybe try to build out more of the functionality. Its also a good intro to flutter if you're interested.

This has evolved more into just an exploration of how to build nice UI, functionality was not considered...
