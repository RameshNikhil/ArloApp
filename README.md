# arlo_app

## 10 hour builds? 
This project came about namely as a way of me trying to build a full application with both front end and backend in less than 10 hours. I will continue to try this, but IRL its a nightmare. 

## Background 
Arlo is a simple gratitude tracker which at haze of the moment had seemed like a great idea + might have been possible to build in 10 hours. I still think if people restrospect on their day and think about the positives they will realise that we generally have life good. 

## What now 
Ummm...feel free to fork the repo and maybe try to build out more of the functionality. Its also a good intro to flutter if you're interested

### The idealistic monologue I recorded at 4am on my iPhone after speaking to a friend about "depression"
Everyone has stress in their day to day lives and it can pile up and get in the way of you accomplishing tasks. I read somewhere, a long time ago, that spending a few minutes a day just reflecting on what you’ve done can be a cathartic experience that helps clear your mind and prepares you to move onto the tasks that need to be done for that day. In fact, that’s why people write journals and meditate. It’s a personal way you can express yourself and therapeutic where it helps you get your day in order.

This is in many ways true and it is why I am writing this myself. This for me is a way I can just spew out any of my thoughts about Arlo with self critiquing helping me better understand my goals. 

I think that if you are able to read this letter on a device while sitting in a somewhat comfortable location then you and I included have a good life. That isn’t to say we don’t have bills to pay or family troubles and a multitude of other problems that really are serious and shouldn’t be taken lightly, but we do have a nice device and the freedom to read this, something many around the world do not have.

My goal for happiereveryday is to provide a platform or environment that allows an individual to come to and spend a few minutes a day just thinking out loud like I am right now. I think that a good way of trying to put some of our lives chaos's into perspective is to think for a minute what we are grateful for. Now this can be generic like “I’m grateful that I have a bed to sleep on today”  or profoundly simple like “today i saw a white butterfly while I stood waiting for my bus, it was beautiful and small and so very un-aware of everything else that is happening in the world and I’m grateful for that because it gave me a sense of calm.” This really did happen today and when I think about what I am grateful for, it gives me a point of focus in this day which isn’t the business of my day to day life. 

In fact I think that is why this even works. By spending just a few minutes everyday thinking about small things that brought us happiness today we shift the focus away from the stresses of our day to day life. 

Ultimately I think Arlo can be a person’s humble abode, a daily escape from the rat race of life and something that just reminds them of what made them happy in the first place for that day. 

Writing this, I am not trying to think of what is the right thing or the wrong thing to say but I’m simply expressing what my thoughts currently are and I am really liking it. Feels like someone is there listening to me ranting and I like that. I’d like happiereveryday to be that person for everyone else who is interested in it. 

Having had this brainstorming process I’d like to focus on two things for happiereveryday. Obviously this will change and evolve over time but starting with my original simple idea of gratefulness with the second being maybe a daily reflection/writing platform. A third could be some sort of happiness/contentedness tracking and filtering so people can see how they went over time. 

Thank you for reading what I had to say, hope you have a happier day! :)
